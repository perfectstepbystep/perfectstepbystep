"declarative", efficient, and "flexible" JavaScript library for building "user interfaces".
React.Component class/type
		In: parameters/props
		Out: Element = hierarchy of views
		2 know: method 'render'
React.element Output of component.render(), html form gets converted to React objects

Use 'className' vs typical DOM 'class'
'<MyClass />' display in the DOM the output of the component MyClass

Passing data around
	via DOM element attribute e.g. 'value'
Calling 'super' in constructor method is compulsory
React does some optimisation in the background: what & when to render
Store state of children in parent when they need to be aggregate
	Pushing a child state down is better than pushing it up to parent for aggregation
'key' React specific attribute
	Can't be accessed via 'this.props.key'
