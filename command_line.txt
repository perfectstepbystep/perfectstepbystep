We use the shell which is a wrapper around the underlying complex engine
The shell is the middle-man: makes our life easy. In charge of RPL (below), background program does E
	Read, Exec, Print, Loop
'-' previous directory I was in...
Typed commands are short & terse > easy automation> achieve a lot with a few keystrokes
Best means to interact with remote resources
Can easily chain task together > repetitive & sequential tasks are handled easily
Store files that change with time in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd-extra-info' (use leading 0s in yrs days month)
	Why use '-' as separator, not '_'?
'$ls -lh' includes the file size in more human readable format

NOTES: 
* Spaces between words is significant in the shell especially around the '=' operator
 e.g. `$PS1='$ '` is different from `PS1 = '$ '`
* Options in commands start with '_' Don't have names of files or folders starting with that
* When using file with space in them, wrap them in "" a more complicated option is to escape the space
* use the flag '-i' on rm/mv (mv silently replace eventually existing files) cmd to acknowledge destructive changes
